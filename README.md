# Clock app

## About

The app displays the current time, day of the week and date. On top of that, it has a countdown timer and a stopwatch, accesible throughout the 2 buttons.
The app can be executed by running the main.exe and it can be installed via clock-installer.

<a possible future update would be an alarm clock which I'm currently thinking about>

## Made with:

I've made this using python only.
The GUI was made with tkinter.
